# Subjective Interestingness In Exploratory Data Mining

### Goal of the paper
This paper aims at providing a general mathematical framework to measure the Subjective Interestingness of a pattern given some observations. Then various applications of this framework to Exploratory Data mining are presented. Finally the framework is compared to existing work.

### Several definitions
The theoretical framework
- Data is defined as an element of a certain (measurable) Space.
- A pattern is defined as an element of the sigma-algebra associated with the measurable set.
- A pattern is said to be present in the data if the data belongs to this pattern.
- A background distribution is a probability defined on the sigma-algebra.
- An Interestingness measure is a real-valued function taking as input a pattern and a background distribution.
